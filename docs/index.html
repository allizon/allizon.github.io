          <h1>Hi there, I'm Allison.</h1>
<p>I'm just getting this page set up...patience, okay?</p>
<h2>Who I Am</h2>
<p>I've been a professional web developer for more than two decades, hard that is to believe. I started working on the website for the magazine I worked for in 1998, fell in love with it and never looked back. That means I'm technically in my fourth different decade of doing this for a living!</p>
<h2>What I've Done</h2>
<p>I've been at this a long time...there were no build tools for anything, these were just websites!</p>
<h2>What I'm Doing Now</h2>
<p>I want to work on something that matters, that makes the world a better place -- and I want to do it with a team of diverse, progressive, talented people who want that, too.</p>
