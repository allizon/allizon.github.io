          <h1>Hi there, I'm Allyn.</h1>
<p>I'm just getting this page set up...patience, okay?</p>
<h2>Who I Am</h2>
<p>I've been a professional web developer for more than two decades, hard that is to believe. I started working on the website for the magazine I worked for in 1998, fell in love with it and never looked back. That means I'm technically in my fourth different decade of doing this for a living!</p>
<h2>What I've Done</h2>
<p>I've worked for several video game companies and even won a Webby award for the work I did at one of them. I've worked as a defense contractor -- if I'm being honest, working at game companies was more fun, but working for big software companies was way more stable and secure.</p>
<p>I've been at this a long time...there were no build tools for anything, these were just websites!</p>
<p>You whippersnappers, what with your frameworks and build systems and tooling and whatnot -- y'all don't know the pain of building all of your HTML and Javascript by hand! You don't know what it's like to have to slice your images to whittle the file size down so your whole page is under a 100kb so it won't take forever to load on dial-up connections! And what's this new-fangled &quot;CSS&quot; thing?</p>
<p>I'm kidding, kinda -- I started there, but for the last few years I've been working primarily in Javascript (mainly React) and Ruby on Rails.</p>
<h2>What I Want To Do</h2>
<p>I want to work on something that matters, something that makes the world a better place -- and I want to do it with a team of diverse, progressive, talented people who want that, too. I want to be an environment where there's always something new to learn, whether that's a new technology or just some new trick to something I've been doing for years.</p>
