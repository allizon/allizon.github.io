# Hi there, I'm Allison.
I'm just getting this page set up...patience, okay?

## Who I Am
I've been a professional web developer for more than two decades, hard that is to believe. I started working on the website for the magazine I worked for in 1998, fell in love with it and never looked back. That means I'm technically in my fourth different decade of doing this for a living!

## What I've Done
I've been at this a long time...there were no build tools for anything, these were just websites!

I've worked for several video game companies and even won a Webby award for the work I did at one of them. I've worked as a defense contractor -- if I'm being honest, working at game companies was more fun, but working for big software companies was way more stable and secure.

## What I'm Doing Now

## What I Want To Do
I want to work on something that matters, something that makes the world a better place -- and I want to do it with a team of diverse, progressive, talented people who want that, too. I want to be an environment where there's always something new to learn, whether that's a new technology or just some new trick to something I've been doing for years.
